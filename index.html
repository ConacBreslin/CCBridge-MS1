                    <h3>What is Bridge?</h3>
                    <p>Bridge is a card game. It involves players playing in pairs against each other to try and win up
                        to 13 tricks in each round. All 52 cards in the pack are dealt out and each player get 13 cards.
                        There are then several stages to the game. The first is called the ‘auction’ and involves the
                        pairs trying to work out how many of the 13 tricks they think they can win (without seeing each
                        others cards). After the auction is over the pair who won the auction (by making the highest
                        bid) play the hand and when the play is over the pair is awarded a score that reflects how close
                        they came to the number bid they made in the auction. Click here to find a link to a website
                        that describes the game in more detail.

                    <h3>Why play Bridge?</h3>
                    <p>Bridge is a fascinating game that people who play it never tire of. Why is that? There are many
                        reasons. Every time you play it is different. There are over 750 trillion possible combinations
                        of bridge hands so it’s unlikely you’ll ever meet the same hand twice. Each hand only lasts 5-10
                        minutes so it’s always changing. Bridge has been shown to exercise your brain – stimulating both
                        sides! It is a unique type of mental activity that can both calm you down and fire you up at the
                        same time. It is a pastime that can last you a lifetime. It is social. It can be played with as
                        few as four people but, in any of the hundreds of clubs around the county, you can play with any
                        number of people. It is cheap – all you need to play at home is a pack of cards and three
                        friends, or a computer. Even in a club it rarely costs more than a few euro to play all evening.
                        It is played all over the country and all over the world.</p>

                    <h3>Is Bridge difficult?</h3>

                    <p>Many people think that bridge it difficult to learn, however as long as you can count to 13 you
                        can learn bridge, and if you can count to 40 then you’re already on your way. How easy or hard
                        you find it can depend on a number of factors. If you have experience of other card games you
                        might find that helps. Choosing to learn in a fun and social environment with a qualified
                        teacher also helps. If you have a friend or family member you can learn with then that is always
                        a great support however, it is not essential to learn with a partner, indeed very many people
                        make great friendships through finding bridge partners. Bridge cannot be absorbed, it has to be
                        actively learned so if you can and devote a little time to it between classes your progress will
                        be faster and easier as you build your knowledge.</p>

                    <h3>Does Bridge take long to learn?</h3>
                    <p>In the past Bridge did take time to learn, however now we begin with simplified versions of the
                        game, like Minibridge and Abridged, and it is possible to start playing hands of bridge after
                        only one lesson! Once you get started it takes at least two terms of lessons before you would be
                        ready to play in a club. After that it is entirely up to you how much more you want to learn.
                        Some people never take any more classes after they have mastered the basics. Most people start
                        playing after they have learned the basics and then return to lessons intermittently when they
                        feel they are ready and want to expand their knowledge. Most advanced players have returned to
                        lessons several times throughout their bridge life.</p>

                                        <p>I was very nervous about moving from lessons to play but CBBridge has
                                            made this
                                            transition easy and fun! There are different sections to play in
                                            depending on your
                                            level. There is support for novices, which is always positive and good
                                            humoured, and although you rarely
                                            get given the answer you are helped to work it our for yourself (and you are
                                            never made to feel daft!). I look forward to
                                            every Tuesday night.</p>
